Importing Required Libraries and Modules:

Warnings: To handle warning messages.
LangChain: For tasks such as loading datasets, splitting text, creating embeddings, storing vectors, and setting up retrieval QA chains.
Transformers: For tokenization, modeling, and pipeline creation.
Requests: To make HTTP requests.
Gradio: To build a user interface.

2.WordPress API Loader

The WordPressAPILoader class is designed to retrieve posts from a WordPress site.

Initialization: Accepts base_url and post_type (defaulting to 'posts') as parameters.
Fetching Posts: The fetch_posts method builds the URL using the provided parameters and retrieves posts through the WordPress REST API.
Loading Posts: The load method invokes fetch_posts to obtain the data.

3. Document Class

Initialization: A simple class Document is defined to hold the content and metadata of each page.

4.Text Splitting

Text Splitter Initialization: The RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter is utilized to divide the text into 1000-character chunks with a 150-character overlap.
Document Splitting: The dataset is split into individual documents using this method.

5.Text Splitting

Text Splitter Initialization: The RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter is used to break the text into 1000-character chunks with a 150-character overlap.
Document Splitting: This method is applied to split the dataset into individual documents.

6.Retriever

Retriever Creation: Constructs a retriever object using the FAISS vector store.
Search Configuration: Sets the retriever to return the top 4 most similar documents.

7.Question Answering Model

Model and Tokenizer: Initializes the tokenizer and model for question answering using "HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta".
Pipeline Definition: Sets up a question-answering pipeline utilizing the tokenizer and model.
LLM Pipeline: Encapsulates the question-answering pipeline within a HuggingFacePipeline.

8.Query Processing Function

Query Handling: Defines a function answer_question to process user queries:
Search: Utilizes the FAISS vector store to find similar documents.
Context Creation: Merges the content of the search results to form a context.
Question Answering: Employs the question-answering pipeline to derive the answer from the context.

9.User Interface with Gradio

Interface Creation: Sets up a Gradio interface for the chatbot.
Function: Utilizes answer_question to process inputs.
Inputs/Outputs: Defines text input and text output.
Title/Description: Provides a title and description for the interface.
Launching Interface: Initiates the Gradio interface.
