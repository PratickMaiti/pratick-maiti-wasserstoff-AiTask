 Building a RAG using an open-source LLM, embeddings model, and LangChain.

 RAG?
 
 RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a popular approach to address the issue of a powerful LLM not being aware of specific content due to said content not being in its training data, or hallucinating even when it has seen it before. Such specific content may be proprietary, sensitive, or, as in this example, recent and updated often.
